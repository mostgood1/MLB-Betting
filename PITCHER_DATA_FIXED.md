# Pitcher Data Fix - COMPLETE âœ…

## ðŸŽ¯ **ISSUE RESOLVED: Pitchers now showing real names instead of TBD**

---

## âœ… **WHAT WAS FIXED**

### **1. Data Fetching Issue** 
- **Problem**: `fetch_today_games.py` had a data structure mismatch
- **Solution**: Fixed the script to handle both list and dict formats in game cache
- **Result**: Now successfully fetches pitcher data from MLB API

### **2. Prediction Generation**
- **Problem**: Prediction generator was using placeholder "TBD" values
- **Solution**: Updated to use real pitcher data from fresh game cache
- **Result**: Predictions now include actual starting pitcher names

### **3. Cache Synchronization**
- **Problem**: Frontend cache wasn't updated with new pitcher data
- **Solution**: Regenerated predictions and synchronized all cache files
- **Result**: Frontend now displays real pitcher names

## ðŸ“Š **CURRENT PITCHER DATA STATUS**

### **Sample Real Pitcher Data Now Showing**:
- **Philadelphia Phillies @ Washington Nationals**: 
  - Away Pitcher: **Zack Wheeler**  
  - Home Pitcher: **MacKenzie Gore**

- **Milwaukee Brewers @ Cincinnati Reds**:
  - Away Pitcher: **TBD** (not announced yet)
  - Home Pitcher: **Nick Martinez**

- **Pittsburgh Pirates @ Chicago Cubs**:
  - Away Pitcher: **TBD** (not announced yet)
  - Home Pitcher: **Colin Rea**

### **Why Some Still Show "TBD"**:
- MLB teams haven't announced all starting pitchers yet
- This is normal - some pitchers are confirmed closer to game time
- "TBD" means "To Be Determined" by the team

## ðŸ”„ **AUTOMATED SOLUTION**

### **Daily Automation Now Includes**:
1. âœ… **Fresh Game Fetch** - Gets latest pitcher announcements from MLB API
2. âœ… **Real Pitcher Data** - Uses `probablePitcher` field from MLB Stats API  
3. âœ… **Prediction Update** - Generates predictions with actual pitcher names
4. âœ… **Frontend Sync** - Updates all cache files automatically

### **API Integration**:
```python
# fetch_today_games.py now correctly extracts:
away_pitcher_data = game.get('teams', {}).get('away', {}).get('probablePitcher', {})
home_pitcher_data = game.get('teams', {}).get('home', {}).get('probablePitcher', {})
away_pitcher = away_pitcher_data.get('fullName', 'TBD')
home_pitcher = home_pitcher_data.get('fullName', 'TBD')
```

## âœ… **VERIFICATION**

### **Frontend Display Now Shows**:
- âœ… **Real pitcher names** for confirmed starters (Zack Wheeler, Colin Rea, etc.)
- âœ… **"TBD"** only for unannounced pitchers (normal MLB behavior)  
- âœ… **Live updates** when teams announce new starters
- âœ… **Consistent data** across all game cards

### **API Endpoint Working**:
- âœ… **`/api/today-games`** returning real pitcher data
- âœ… **Predictions cache** updated with correct information
- âœ… **Game cards** displaying proper pitcher matchups
