## Optimization Summary
Based on the tuning analysis showing:
- Score MAE: 2.51 (Target: <1.5)  
- Win Accuracy: 54.3% (Target: >58%)
- Betting ROI: 0.0% (Target: >5%)
- Overall Grade: F (Target: B or higher)

## Applied Optimizations

### 1. Score Prediction Accuracy
**Problem**: High prediction error (MAE: 2.51 runs)
**Solution**: Enhanced pitcher impact weights and regression factors
- Pitcher ERA weight: 0.35 to 0.45 (+29%)
- Recent form weight: 0.25 to 0.35 (+40%)  
- Added regression to mean factor: 0.20
- **Expected Impact**: Reduce MAE to ~1.8 runs

### 2. Win Probability Accuracy  
**Problem**: Low win prediction accuracy (54.3%)
**Solution**: Improved team strength and game factors
- Home field advantage: 0.15 to 0.20 (+33%)
- Head-to-head weight: 0.20 to 0.25 (+25%)
- Enhanced confidence calibration
- **Expected Impact**: Increase accuracy to ~58%

### 3. Betting ROI Performance
**Problem**: Zero betting return on investment
**Solution**: Enhanced selectivity and edge detection
- Minimum edge threshold: 5% to 8% (+60%)
- High confidence threshold: 0.65 to 0.70 (+8%)
- Target ROI: 8% to 12% (+50%)
- **Expected Impact**: Achieve 5-8% ROI
