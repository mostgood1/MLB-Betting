# 🔍 **TBD PITCHER ISSUE ANALYSIS**

## 🎯 **Root Cause Found:**

The debug logs clearly show that Flask **IS** loading the correct pitcher information:

```
🔍 PITCHER DEBUG for San Diego Padres @ Los Angeles Dodgers: away=Wandy Peralta, home=Clayton Kershaw
```

**But the API still returns "TBD"** - this indicates there's a transformation or override happening after the data is loaded.

## 🔧 **Immediate Fix Needed:**

Since the unified cache has the correct data (`Wandy Peralta`) but something is overriding it to `TBD`, we need to:

1. **Add direct pitcher override** for live games
2. **Check for any TBD replacement logic** that might be incorrectly triggering
3. **Ensure live game pitcher updates** are preserved

## 📊 **Current Status:**
- ✅ **Data Source**: Unified cache has correct "Wandy Peralta"
- ✅ **Flask Loading**: Debug shows "away=Wandy Peralta" 
- ❌ **API Response**: Still returns "TBD"
- 🔄 **Live Status**: Game shows "Game Over" (finished)

## 🚀 **Solution:**
Apply a direct fix to ensure live games with known pitchers don't show TBD, regardless of other data processing.
